## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about Mobile-first workflow, how to use better media query and started again to study css to recall all the things i have already study.

### Continued development

I want to keep studying css to get it better, I found out that I have forgot a lot of things about it and to learn a lot about media query, it has been a hard subject to me.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me to recall some properties of css and how to use them.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
